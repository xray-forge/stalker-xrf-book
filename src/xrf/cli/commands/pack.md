## ️️ Building custom game package

XRF template provides CLI and utils for creation of custom game repacks. <br/>
Instead of building `gamedata` folder and distributing it as a separate `zip`, mods can be packed in `.db` archives
and bundled together with custom engine.

### Pre-requirements

Comparing to normal gamedata builds the only needed thing is full assets list. <br/>
To build package you will need [extended](https://gitlab.com/xray-forge/stalker-xrf-resources-extended) assets
and one of locales packs, for example [eng](https://gitlab.com/xray-forge/stalker-xrf-resources-locale-eng). <br/>

After cloning suggested repositories or providing custom assets, you should list them in 'config.json' if paths are different from already suggested.

### Running build

If assets are downloaded and configured correctly, the only needed thing is one of following:

```
npm run cli pack game -- --clean --optimize

# or
npm run cli pack game -- -c -o

# or
npm run pack:game
```

As result, new package will be created in `target` folder.

If you want to 'just build' package for testing from existing assets without full build/compress cycle, you can use alternative:

```
npm run cli pack game -- --engine release --no-build
```
