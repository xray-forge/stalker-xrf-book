# ðŸ¥‘ Building

Building is process of compiling all the XRF project code and assets into x-ray engine format. <br/>
It uses set of ordered sets to transform different parts of engine in a right way.

## Command

- `npm run cli build`
- `npx xrf build`

## Options

- `-i, --include <targets...>` - include build targets (default: include all targets)
- `-e, --exclude <targets...>` - exclude build target
- `-v, --verbose` - print verbose build logs
- `-l, --language <language>` - language to use when building mod
- `-f, --filter <targets...>` - filter files with regex (default: [])
- `-c, --clean` - perform target clean before build
- `--nl, --no-lua-logs` - strip all lua logs from target build
- `--na, --no-asset-overrides` - skip step with building additional assets
- `-h, --help` - display help for command

## Build steps

- `cleanup` - clean target destination before build start
- `dynamic_scripts` - build typescript based game scripts into lua
- `dynamic_ui` - build JSX based forms into static XML forms
- `static_ui` - copy static XML forms
- `dynamic_configs` - build dynamic typescript based configs into ltx
- `static_configs` - copy static LTX configs
- `dynamic_translations` - build JSON based multi-language translation files in xml
- `static_translations` - copy static XML based translation files
- `static_resources` - copy game assets (textures, sounds, levels, shaders etc.)
- `collect_metadata_and_log` - collect build result size/timing summary, collect build process log file

## Separate modules

To make development smoother and faster, it is recommended to rebuild only needed assets.
Example: changing ui forms, no need to rebuild configs, translations and other parts.
In this case building `-i ui` is better variant.

`npm run cli build -- -i ui`

## Watch mode

- [scripts build in watch mode](building_scripts.md#watch-mode).

## Examples

- `npm run cli build` - start regular build of xrf engine
- `npm run cli build -- -c` - start clean build of xrf engine
- `npm run cli build -- -e resources` - build everything except static resources
- `npm run cli build -- -i scripts configs` - build only game scripts and configs
- `npm run cli build -- -i configs -f system.ltx` - build only game configs that have system.ltx in part of their name
