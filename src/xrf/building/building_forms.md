## ðŸ§° Custom forms and UI

Notes:

- When creating forms, use [JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html)
- When the engine mod compilation happens, JSX is transformed to valid XML
- All coordinates with (x, y) are based on 'attach' parent (not XML child, rather script register parent) and related
- Use `preview` command to preview forms and develop faster, example: `npm run preview menu`

For examples check: `src/engine/forms`.
