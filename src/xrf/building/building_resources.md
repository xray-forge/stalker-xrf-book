## Diff checker

To optimize build times, diff checker is used for static assets. When rebuilding the project not in `clean` mode,
cli checks diff between source and resulting files and decides whether new copy with replacement is needed.
As result, building static assets may take few seconds instead of few minutes.

## Additional assets

Additional assets repository can be cloned manually or with shortcut command: <br/>
`npm run cli clone *name*` (`extended`, `locale-eng`, `locale-ukr`, `locale-rus`)
